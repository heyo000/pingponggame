# Ping Pong!
### This Ping Pong Game is really really simple
You use the keys W and S to move the left paddle, and Up and Down keys for the right paddle. You try to keep the ball from going beyond the side that the paddle is on. If the ball hits the paddle, it changes direction. (This is technically a two-player game on one computer...) It's as simple as that.
